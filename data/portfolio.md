Job Stories
1. When I have lots of assignments, deadlines or meetings to keep track of,
   I want to store them in one organised place,
   So I can avoid forgetting important tasks.

2. When I need to recall an action I made earlier,
   I want to check my previous tasks easily,
   So I can remember what I planned without confusion.

3. When my tasks change,
   I want to edit my existing tasks,
   So I can keep my task list updated.

4. When I have many tasks in progress,
   I want to filter them by category, name, or type,
   So I can focus only on similar tasks that I want to work on right now.

5. When I finish a task,
   I want to delete it or mark it as done,
   So I can keep my task tidy and up to date.

6. When I am trying to read the tasks but the text is too small,
   I want to zoom it to my own need
   So I am able to see the tasks clearly.

## Consent Process

**Before starting** (read aloud):

> "Thanks for agreeing to pilot our prototype. This is a quick usability test—about 15 minutes. I'll ask you to complete 4 tasks while I observe and take notes. I'm testing the interface, not you, so there are no wrong answers.
>
> **What we're collecting**:
> - Task completion times (from server logs)
> - Whether you complete each task successfully
> - Errors or validation issues
> - Your confidence ratings after each task
> - My notes on any hesitations or accessibility issues
>
> **What we're NOT collecting**:
> - Your name, email, or student ID
> - Screen recordings or audio
> - Your device details beyond 'keyboard-only' or 'screen reader'
>
> I'll assign you a random session code (like `sid=X7kL9p`) which will appear in the logs. You can request that I delete all data linked to your session code at any time, even after today.
>
> **You can stop at any time**, no questions asked, and it won't affect your grade.
>
> Do you have any questions before we start?"

**Verbal consent**: "Are you happy to proceed?"
