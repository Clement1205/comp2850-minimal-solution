Pilot Study Tasks:

Task 1: You have a meeting with John upcoming Monday in Room A. Add it to the task.

Time Spent: 10:57
Comments: "9/10, I got some notifications when the task is completed (at the top left corner),
would like it to be more clearly"


Task 2: Are you able to see the previous actions you have made? For example, you added a meeting
before but you forgot what that is. Are you able to check it?

Time Spent: 03:23
Comments: "It was easy to find the task, although may be hard if there are larger amounts"


Task 3: Edit "buy milk" into "buy corn flakes"

Time Spent: 9:73
Comments: "It was easy to edit a task as the edit box was inlined with the task name."


Task 4: Use the filter to see how many items you have to buy.

Time Spent: 12:02
Comments: "The notification was nice to show the amount."


Task 5: You just bought bananas. Delete them from the checklist.

Time Spent: 07:15
Comments: "The confirmation to confirm the deletion was useful, and I appreciate that."

Task 6: Your friend has sight-issues and cannot see words that are too small. Are you able to zoom
it bigger for him to see the tasks?

Time Spent: 15:18
Comments: "The control plus shortcut is widely used and the support by the application 
makes it easy to utilize the features"

When [situation/context],
I want [motivation/capability],
So [outcome/benefit],
Because [underlying need].
You should have 3-6 stories in total. One story may inform more than one pilot study task.

Story #1
When I have lots of assignments, deadlines or meetings to keep track of,
I want to store them in one organised place,
So I can avoid forgetting important tasks.

Story #2
When I need to recall an action I made earlier,
I want to check my previous tasks easily,
So I can remember what I planned without confusion.

Story #3
When my tasks change,
I want to edit my existing tasks,
So I can keep my task list updated.

# Peer Pilot Protocol — Week 9

## Study Overview

**Purpose**: Evaluate usability and accessibility of task list prototype with peer participants.

**Type**: Low-risk formative evaluation, peer-to-peer within module.

**Scope**:
- 5–6 participants (lab pairs)
- 4 tasks per session (~15–20 minutes)
- No audio/video recording
- No personally identifiable information collected

**Ethical approval**: Covered by module's blanket low-risk consent for peer learning activities (verified with module leader).

**Data retention**: Anonymised logs stored in private repo for academic year, deleted after module assessment complete.

---

## Participant Requirements

**Inclusion**:
- Enrolled in COMP2850
- Comfortable using web browsers
- Able to provide informed consent

**Exclusion**:
- None (module is inclusive by design)

**Accessibility accommodations**:
- Screen reader users: allowed extra time, SR-specific observations recorded separately
- Keyboard-only users: explicitly invited to test no-mouse variant
- No-JS users: at least one session conducted with JS disabled

---

## Consent Process

**Before starting** (read aloud):

> "Thanks for agreeing to pilot our prototype. This is a quick usability test—about 15 minutes. I'll ask you to complete 4 tasks while I observe and take notes. I'm testing the interface, not you, so there are no wrong answers.
>
> **What we're collecting**:
> - Task completion times (from server logs)
> - Whether you complete each task successfully
> - Errors or validation issues
> - Your confidence ratings after each task
> - My notes on any hesitations or accessibility issues
>
> **What we're NOT collecting**:
> - Your name, email, or student ID
> - Screen recordings or audio
> - Your device details beyond 'keyboard-only' or 'screen reader'
>
> I'll assign you a random session code (like `sid=X7kL9p`) which will appear in the logs. You can request that I delete all data linked to your session code at any time, even after today.
>
> **You can stop at any time**, no questions asked, and it won't affect your grade.
>
> Do you have any questions before we start?"

**Verbal consent**: "Are you happy to proceed?"

Metrics Breakdown
Task	Target Time	Mean Time	Median Time	Range of Times	Target - Mean
EXAMPLE TASK	< 10	12.7	9.3	7.6 – 17.3	-2.7





Reflection / Initial Thoughts
Use this space to informally discuss your results, both qualitative and quantitative, and any initial trends which you spotted.
Example:
Although mouse, keyboard and screen users were able to consistently complete tasks in under the target time, keyboard-only users found it more challenging due to having to move backwards and forwards on the page, leading to significantly higher times for all tasks. 
Findings
You will now formalise your thoughts, reflections and data gathered from your pilot study into some findings which should be single issues with the site which you have identified from your evidence.
Finding	Source	Observation	WCAG	Impact
(1-5)	Inclusion
(1-5)	Effort
(1-5)	Priority
(Im + In – E)
EXAMPLE
Screen reader – errors not announced	metrics.csv L47-49 + P2 notes 14:23	P2: “I didn’t hear any error”	3.3.1 Level A	5	5	3	7







Fixes To Implement
In this section you will select and explain up to three fixes you will be making based on your findings from the table.
These should be high priority findings, particularly those with WCAG Level A issues.
Fix 1
Finding: [the finding from the table above]
Explanation: [explain what the current issue is in simple terms]
Original Code: [paste/screenshot the code which you believe caused this error]
Fix: [Explain how you fixed this issue or explain what you did if you cannot work out how to fix the issue in a reasonable amount of time]
Final Code: [paste/screenshot the final, edited code of your fix – if you used generative AI to support your coding you should acknowledge that here.]

Fix 2
Finding: [the finding from the table above]
Explanation: [explain what the current issue is in simple terms]
Original Code: [paste/screenshot the code which you believe caused this error]
Fix: [Explain how you fixed this issue or explain what you did if you cannot work out how to fix the issue in a reasonable amount of time]
Final Code: [paste/screenshot the final, edited code of your fix – if you used generative AI to support your coding you should acknowledge that here.]

Fix 3
Finding: [the finding from the table above]
Explanation: [explain what the current issue is in simple terms]
Original Code: [paste/screenshot the code which you believe caused this error]
Fix: [Explain how you fixed this issue or explain what you did if you cannot work out how to fix the issue in a reasonable amount of time]
Final Code: [paste/screenshot the final, edited code of your fix – if you used generative AI to support your coding you should acknowledge that here.]
WCAG Checklist
Once you have made your code changes and tested the site yourself, you should work through the WCAG checklist below, recording whether your app passes or fails, with a note stating why.
Be honest – if you have not met a criterion, you can explain why in the next section.
Check	Criterion	Level	Pass/Fail?	Notes
Keyboard
K1	2.1.1 All actions keyboard accessible	A	[pass/fail]	e.g., “Tested Tab/Enter on all buttons”
K2	2.4.7 Focus visible	AA	[pass/fail]
K3	No keyboard traps	A	[pass/fail]
K4	Logical tab order	A	[pass/fail]
K5	Skip links present	AA	[pass/fail/n/a]
Forms
F1	3.3.2 Labels present	A	[pass/fail]
F2	3.3.1 Errors identified	A	[pass/fail]
F3	4.1.2 Name/role/value	A	[pass/fail]
Dynamic Content
D1	4.1.3 Status messages	AA	[pass/fail]
D2	Live regions work	AA	[pass/fail]
D3	Focus management	A	[pass/fail]
No-JS
V1	1.4.3 Contrast minimum	AA	[pass/fail]
V2	1.4.4 Resize text	AA	[pass/fail]
V3	1.4.11 Non-text contrast	AA	[pass/fail]
Semantic
S1	1.3.1 Headings hierarchy	A	[pass/fail]
S2	2.4.1 Bypass blocks	A	[pass/fail]
S3	1.1.1 Alt text	A	[pass/fail]	
 

Any Missing Criteria
If you did not meet any criteria, please note the number of the criteria (e.g. K2) and a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation of how you are not currently meeting it and a quick explanation of how you could address this.
Example with an alternative WCAG criterion:
E7 Error Suggestion – At present, when you try and edit a priority to a non-numerical value it gives an error but does not clarify how to meet the validation check. I could change this by giving more details in the alert such as ‘This must be a positive number’.
 
Second Pilot
You will re-run your pilot with 1-2 participants in order to evidence whether your changes improved the site.
