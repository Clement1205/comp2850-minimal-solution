Q1. Can you tell me about the last time you use a task manager or a to-do-list, what are you trying to achieve?
A1: I have so many assignments and deadlines, so I want to use a task manager to store the tasks as a summary so that i will not forget.
A2: I use it for arranging my schedules. My goal is to allocate time wisely and show up at each appointment punctually.
A3: I use it to mark down what I have to do that day, especially working at home. Coz my working efficiency is quite low when I am at home, so I wanna get things done quickly instead of postponing to another day
A4: To stop a task from running manually

Q2. What frustrates you the most when using task managers?
A1: With bad filtering, can't find the right tasks.
A2: Haven't seen any good apps for automating this process. I had to design my own Excel spreadsheet lol but I believe there are better ways.
A3: Nothing actually
A4: Nothing frustrates me

Q3. Have you ever struggled to find a task?
A1: sometimes, but not much, as I filter by date so it is really easy to find the tasks by matching with the deadlines.
A2: No; all tasks are usually shown on one page.
A3: Yes only when I am in the semester break and I don't have an intern
A4: Not really, the tasks that I am looking for are usually on the top of the list

Q4. Do you often use keyboards or other utilities while using task managers?
A1: not really, mine's a to-do app, so all I need is to click on their interface to record tasks and mark as done.
A2: I use the keyboard and the mouse quite often.
A3: Usually I write my to do list in WhatsApp private chat so I only use keyboard.
A4: Use mouse

Q5. To what extent does brightness, low contrast affect your ability to see the tasks?
A1: A low extent, as long as I can see the tasks clearly and not to bright or too low then will be okay.
A2: Score = 4/5, affect to a large extent.
A3: 3/5, usually you will remember what to do after writing it out, so you don't actually need to see the tasks
A4: 3/5, can’t see the item if it’s too dim
